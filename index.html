      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As an experienced professional I have acquired various skills over the years and maintained
        an exceptional work ethic which has allowed me to be an effective member of my previous teams.
        Most recently as an emergency response officer with the Metropolitan Police Service, 
        I have developed a strong teamwork ethic which is vital to achieving goals. 
        In my previous role with Stolt Nielsen, I was able to be an effective change agent for adopting 
        new technologies and processes within the operations team and successfully assisted with 
        the implementation of new electronic job systems and developing new working methods to 
        complement the new systems. I am a passionate advocate for technology and was able to build a 
        web-based training platform for new members of the team using foundational web technologies.

            for responding to emergency calls received from members of the public. This highly
            active role requires fast response times and co-ordination of intelligence by

            and assigning suitable units, liaising with vendors to allocate work and ensuring that required
